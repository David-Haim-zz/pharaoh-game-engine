libraries need to be in the compiler and linker's path.  If linking dynamically
to a library, make sure the DLL is accessible by the application.

* SDL (http://www.libsdl.org)
* OpenGL (http://www.opengl.org)
* TinyXML (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml)
* OIS - Object Oriented Input System (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois)
